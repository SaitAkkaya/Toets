        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p>
            Sport equipment to protect the person wearing it, before any sport had any <em>protection</em> there would be many injuries leaving long term injuries in some cases making the player unable to continue the sport or even making them unable to continue their life in a normal way. Safety is right now the number one priority when playing a sport, when having a compition or when you're training you're always  required to wear safety equipment.
        </p>
        <h2>What does it solve exactly?</h2>
        <p>
            Not only does it solve the problem of injuries it also has <em>sensors</em> that measure the way the player plays. So that the player can look back on how they've played and juries can look back if the player had cheated in any kind of way by looking at the statistics. Sadly the equipment doesn't prevent all injuries but most of the time it does. There is also less chances of having a long term injuries.
        </p>
        <h2>How to use it?</h2>
        <p>
            There are many different types of equipment, some are specially designed for a specific sport and some are universal meaning they can be used for many different kinds of sports. To use them you have to follow the instructions that you get when you're buying the equipment, or you could ask your trainer/coach to help you with using and wearing the equipment so you can make sure you're doing it right for you not to have any injuries.
        </p>
        <h2>Stars that use equipment</h2>
        <p>
            There are many famous athletes stars sporters that use the equipment for their own safety and the others. They also use it to see their own statistics and how they can improve themselves in the future. When you're watching a live sport event you can always see that the person is wearing some kind of equipment this is mostly for their safety so its never wrong to wear a safety equipment.
        </p>
        <h2>What can we expect from the company?</h2>
        <p>
            The company makes the high quality equipment so you know for sure that you're not using anything made out of cheap materials making you more vulnurable. They also guarantee that if the equipment breaks down you could get a new one replaced for half of the price. They also give clear instructions and also video's on how you could use the equipment for safety and for the measurements analytics so you can improve yourself.
        </p>
        <h2>Future of the equipment</h2>
        <p>
            The safety equipment hasn't reached it's peak yet there are still new ways being found out at the time on the safety and on the measurements side. So we're far from the end as of right now, mainly because there are many new sports coming out requiring new types of equipment's specially made for the sport. There are also equipment's that get improved every year making sure its a perfect equipment without any faulty things making the user less vulnerable for injuries.
