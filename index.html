            <h2>race timing</h2>
            <p>In the past, many mistakes happened in racing, with erroneous results shared with sports where minutes to seconds determine who wins. With the latest <em>technology</em>, we can now know exactly how many seconds it took someone to win. This can be used in many different sports. It also uses sensors to determine the exact number of seconds in a race so there are even fewer mistakes. And this way we can have the exact results.</p>

            <h2>Protection</h2>
            <p>During many competitions or exercise there are many injuries. But that is no longer the case with all the new types of protections so there are <em>injuries</em>. There are many types of protection that can be used. Some are made especially for one particular sport or competition. There are also many protections that are universal which means that you can use them for any sport without having to buy something extra for a particular sport.</p>

            <h2>Sensors</h2>
            <p>There are many sensors that are used in a sport, such as during <em>practice or during a big game</em>. With these, trainers and judges check that everything is correct and no mistakes have been made. This allows the player to develop better in the sport with the information that comes from the sensors. Many sensors are also used during matches to check for cheating and to determine who won fairly.</p>
